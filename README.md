# hitbtc API 2 Python wrapper

I was unable to find a good python wrapper for hitbtc that worked for me. I wrote my own here that implemented the functions I needed, but it should be easy to use the shell I've created here and the documentation (https://github.com/hitbtc-com/hitbtc-api/blob/master/APIv2.md) to add whatever other functions you want.

Hope this helps someone save some time.
